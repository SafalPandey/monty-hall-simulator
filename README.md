# monty-hall-simulator

To demonstrate how switching or not switching your first pick in the Monty Hall problem affects your chances to win the game.
[Read here for more info on the Monty Hall problem itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem).

## Additional inputs

1. Max iterations:

    Defines how many iterations of the simulation/game to run before showing results.
    This helps to demonstrate how the strategy doesn't affect a single game.
    Also, demonstrates the probability distribution for different max iterations.

2. Randomize revealed door (checkbox):

    Controls how the revealed door is selected.
    This helps to demonstrate if the door is revealed randomly, then the advantage of switching is nullified.
